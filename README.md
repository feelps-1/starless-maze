# Starless Maze
## Lore
From Chaos a being has aroused among the first entities to ever exist: **The Night**. Cosmus inhabit it, and stars lie amidst the deep Darkness, rooming the void and the vault, bringing light to the gloom and guidance to the doom. It’s **Nyx**: Night itself. <br>
Hypnos, _god of sleep_ and one of her sons, once made the Grand Zeus to fall asleep, due to the schemings of Hera, but when Zeus has woken from his slumber, full of anger, almost hurled him into deep sea, if it was not for the protection of **Nyx**, his mother. This way, Hypnos was saved, for **Nyx** is powerful and feared even by Zeus. <br>
But the wrath of Zeus has never calmed down, it has just been contained, and the grudge against Hypnos has just grown bigger. So Zeus, attempting to get revenge from Hypnos, tried to weaken the powers of **Nyx**, in order to Hypnos to be unprotected. The, he stoled the essences of the Night: _Stars_, the _Cosmic dusts_ and the _Moon_. Those he spread and imprisoned through a Labyrinth, where no god could set a foot due to a great spell, this way **Nyx** could never retrieve her powers back. That was the **Day of the Doom**, not for **Nyx**, but for all existence. <br>
For losing the essences of the Night, and being robbed and fouled by Zeus, Nyx fell into deep Madness, far worse than the Zeus Wrath, and the World has been engulfed in profound darkness, neither Sun nor Apolo has any power against her. <br> <br>

***"Now, oh hero, all hope of the world, even from the imortals gods, lies upon thy shoulders, a mere human. Ye shall challenge The Starless Maze, where mighty darkness dwells at most density and power, break the chains imprisoning the essences of Nyx and lay them in the altar in the middle of the maze."***
